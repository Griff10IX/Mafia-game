<summary><strong>Users & Online</strong></summary>
<div>

**Who shows as “online”?**  
Anyone active in the **last 5 minutes**. Dead and bodyguard accounts are excluded.

**How do I search for a player?**  
Search by username (substring, case-insensitive). Results: online, offline, and dead. Robot bodyguards only show when you search their exact full name.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ranks & Prestige</strong></summary>
<div>

**How does rank work?**  
Rank is based on **rank points**. You earn them from: crimes, GTA, jail busts, Organised Crime heists, and kills.

**Rank ladder (by rank points):**
- Rat (0)
- Street Thug (250)
- Hustler (1,000)
- Goon (3,000)
- Made Man (6,000)
- Capo (12,000)
- Underboss (24,000)
- Consigliere (50,000)
- Boss (100,000)
- Don (200,000)
- **Godfather (400,000)**

**Wealth rank:**  
Based only on **cash on hand** (not bank or Swiss). Shown on your profile.
- Broke ($0) → … → Millionaire ($1M) → Billionaire ($1B) → Multi Trillionaire ($10T+)

**Prestige (after Godfather):**  
At Godfather you can **Prestige**. Five levels: Made, Earner, Capo di Capi, The Don, Godfather Legacy.  
Each level makes the next Godfather grind harder but gives bonuses (e.g. higher crime cash, OC payouts, GTA rare car chance, NPC payouts).  
Prestiging resets your rank to Rat and rank points to 0; you keep your prestige level and its bonuses.
</div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Crimes</strong></summary>
<div>

**How do crimes work?**  
Each crime has a **minimum rank**, **reward range** (cash + RP), and a **cooldown**. You must not be in jail.

**Success chance:**  
A **progress bar (10%–92%)**. Success +6–8%; failure −1–3%. At 92% the floor is 77%. Daily events can change cash/RP multipliers.

**RP on success:**
- Petty: 3 RP
- Medium: 7 RP
- Major: 15 RP

**Examples:**  
Petty: Pickpocket, Mug a Pedestrian. Medium: Bootlegging, Armed Robbery, Extortion. Major: Jewelry Heist, Bank Heist, Casino Heist. Higher ranks unlock harder crimes (bigger rewards, longer cooldowns).

**Stats:**  
Crimes page shows: crimes today/week, successful attempts, profit (today, 24h, week).

**On success:**  
Random car (common → legendary). Often **15–77% damage** (uncommon sometimes 0–14%). You get cash (car value) and RP (5 common → 100 legendary). Prestige improves rare car chance.

**On failure:**  
40% **caught** → jail (location’s time, e.g. 8–50s). Otherwise escape, no car.
