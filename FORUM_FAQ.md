<summary><strong>Users & Online</strong></summary>
<div>

**Who shows as “online”?**  
Players who were active in the **last 5 minutes**. Dead accounts and bodyguard accounts are excluded.

**How do I search for a player?**  
Use the user search by username (substring, case-insensitive). Results include online, offline, and dead players. Robot bodyguards only appear when you search their exact full name.

<details>
<summary><strong>Ranks & Prestige</strong></summary>
<div>

**How does rank work?**  
Rank is based only on **rank points**. You earn rank points from crimes, GTA, jail busts, Organised Crime heists, and kills.

**Rank ladder (by rank points):**  
Rat (0) → Street Thug (250) → Hustler (1,000) → Goon (3,000) → Made Man (6,000) → Capo (12,000) → Underboss (24,000) → Consigliere (50,000) → Boss (100,000) → Don (200,000) → **Godfather (400,000)**.

**Wealth rank:**  
Based only on **cash on hand** (not bank or Swiss). From Broke ($0) up through Millionaire ($1M), Billionaire ($1B), and Multi Trillionaire ($10T+). Shown on your profile.

**Prestige (after Godfather):**  
Once you reach Godfather you can **Prestige**. There are 5 prestige levels (Made, Earner, Capo di Capi, The Don, Godfather Legacy). Each level makes the next Godfather grind harder but gives bonuses: higher crime cash, OC payouts, GTA rare car chance, and NPC payouts. Prestiging resets your rank to Rat and rank points to 0; you keep your prestige level and its bonuses.
</div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Crimes</strong></summary>
<div>

**How do crimes work?**  
Each crime has a **minimum rank**, **reward range** (cash + rank points), and a **cooldown** after you commit it. You must not be in jail to commit crimes.

**Success chance (progress bar):**  
Your success rate is a **progress bar between 10% and 92%**. Success adds 6–8%; failure drops 1–3%. Once you’ve reached 92%, the floor is 77% (you never drop below that from failures). Daily events can change crime cash and rank point multipliers.

**Crime types and rank points on success:**  
- Petty: 3 RP  
- Medium: 7 RP  
- Major: 15 RP  

**Crimes list (examples):**  
Pickpocket, Mug a Pedestrian (petty); Bootlegging, Armed Robbery, Extortion (medium); Jewelry Heist, Bank Heist, Casino Heist (major). Higher ranks unlock harder crimes with bigger rewards and longer cooldowns.

**Stats:**  
You can see crimes today/week, successful attempts, and profit (today, 24h, week) on the Crimes page.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GTA (Grand Theft Auto)</strong></summary>
<div>

**What is GTA?**  
You choose a **location** (Street Parking, Residential Area, Downtown, Luxury Garage, Private Estate). Each location unlocks at a certain rank, has a **success rate**, **jail time** if caught, and a **cooldown** (e.g. 20s to 180s). One global cooldown applies after each attempt.

**Progress bar:**  
GTA uses a **25–92%** progress bar. Success adds 4–6%; failure drops 1–2%. Once at 92%, floor is 80%. Daily events can boost GTA success chance (e.g. 2× GTA day).

**On success:**  
You get a random car for that location’s difficulty (common → legendary). Stolen cars often have **15–77% damage** (sometimes 0–14% for uncommon). You get cash (car value) and rank points (5 for common up to 100 for legendary). Prestige increases the chance of rarer cars.

**On failure:**  
40% chance you get **caught** and go to jail for that location’s jail time (e.g. 8–50 seconds). Otherwise you get away but no car.

**Garage:**  
- **Melt for bullets:** Turn cars into bullets (value ÷ 10 per car). One melt action has a **45-second cooldown** per car melted; batch limit applies (see Store).  
- **Scrap for cash:** Turn cars into 50% of their value. No cooldown; batch limit applies.  
You cannot melt or scrap a car that is **listed for sale**; delist it first.

**Dealer:**  
Buy cars for **1.2× value** (cash). Stock is limited per model and restocks over time. Custom and exclusive cars are not sold by the dealer.

**Marketplace:**  
List your cars for sale (set a price). Other players can buy them for cash. You can also **buy** other players’ listed cars.

**Repair:**  
Damaged cars can be repaired for a cost (reduces damage %).

**Travel:**  
Cars have a **travel time** (seconds) by rarity (e.g. common ~45s, legendary ~12s, airport instant). Better cars = faster travel.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Casinos</strong></summary>
<div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Families</strong></summary>
<div>

**Basics:**  
Up to **10 families** in the game. Each has a **name** and **tag** (2–4 characters). You can **create** a family (you become Boss) or **join** an existing one (you start as Associate).

**Roles (in order):**  
Boss (1) → Underboss (1) → Consigliere (1) → Capo (4) → Soldier (15) → Associate (30). Only the **Boss** can assign roles; Boss and Underboss can **kick**; Boss, Underboss, Consigliere can **withdraw** from treasury and manage rackets (unlock/upgrade).

**Treasury:**  
Members **deposit** cash into the family treasury. Boss, Underboss, Consigliere can **withdraw**. Used for racket unlocks/upgrades and family operations.

**Rackets:**  
Nine racket types (e.g. Protection, Gambling, Loan Sharking, Labour, Distillery, Warehouse, Restaurant & Bar, Funeral Home, Garment Shop). Each has **cooldown hours** and **base income per level**.  
- First racket starts at level 1.  
- **Unlock** next racket: $100,000 from treasury; previous racket must be level 5.  
- **Upgrade** a racket: $50,000 per level (max level 5).  
- **Collect** income when the cooldown has passed; income = base × level (events can change payout % and cooldown speed).

**Racket raids (war):**  
During a family war, you can **raid** an enemy family’s rackets. Success chance depends on racket level (higher level = harder to raid). On success you take a portion of their racket revenue; on failure you get nothing.

**Crew OC (Organised Crime):**  
- Boss, Underboss, or Capo can **set a join fee** (cash) for outsiders to join the crew for the next run.  
- They can **advertise** (creates a Crew OC forum topic).  
- **Apply** (as non-member): pay the fee or submit for free; family accepts/rejects.  
- When Boss/Underboss/Capo **commits** Crew OC: all living family members + accepted applicants get **rewards** (RP, cash, bullets, points, booze) and the **treasury** gets a lump sum. Then an **8-hour cooldown** (6 hours if the committer has the timer reduction).  
- Applications are cleared after each commit.

**Family wars (Vendetta):**  
Families can be at **war**. Wars track kills, deaths, and bodyguard kills. Truce can be offered/accepted. When a family is **wiped** (all members dead), the winning family can receive rackets and treasury. Wars have a kill feed and stats.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Attacks & Combat</strong></summary>
<div>

**Flow:**  
1. **Search** for a target by username (takes ~2–3 minutes).  
2. Target is **found** in a random **city**.  
3. If you’re not in that city, **travel** there (car or airport).  
4. When you’re in the same city, **execute** the attack.

**Who can I attack?**  
Any living player (not dead, not yourself). NPCs can only be attacked if they’re on your hitlist. Bodyguards can be targeted; killing them counts for war stats if you’re at war with the owner’s family.

**Bullets to kill:**  
Depends on **target armour**, **target rank**, **your weapon damage**, and **your rank**. Higher armour and rank = more bullets needed; better weapon and higher attacker rank = fewer bullets. The game clamps the result between 5,000 and 100,000 bullets. Use the calculator on the Attack page.

**Bodyguards:**  
Targets can have **bodyguards** (hired players or robots). You must get through bodyguards first (in slot order). Each bodyguard has armour and absorbs bullets; when they “die” they’re removed. You can choose how many bullets to use in the attack.

**On kill:**  
- You get **25% of the victim’s cash on hand** and rank points.  
- Daily events can double kill cash or rank points.  
- If the victim had a bounty (hitlist), you may get the bounty reward.  
- War stats are updated if both sides are in a family war.

**Attempts:**  
Your **Attempts** page shows your recent attacks and attacks on you (search, travel, execute, result).
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hitlist</strong></summary>
<div>

**Place a bounty:**  
You can put a bounty on a **player** (yourself or someone else) or on their **bodyguards**. Rewards can be **cash**, **points**, or both. You pay the reward amount (or more for hidden bounties).

**Hidden bounty:**  
If you mark the bounty as **hidden**, it costs **50% more** (cash and/or points). The placer’s name is not shown publicly.

**Buy off:**  
To remove a bounty (on you or someone else), you **buy it off** for **150%** of the total reward (e.g. $100 bounty → $150 to clear). Same for points.

**Claiming a bounty:**  
When you **kill** the target (player or bodyguard), you receive the bounty reward (cash/points). Only the killer gets it.

**Hitlist NPCs:**  
Special NPCs can appear on the hitlist with set rewards (cash, points, bullets, booze, cars, rank points). They have a cooldown between spawns. Killing them counts toward hitlist-NPC objectives.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Jail</strong></summary>
<div>

**How do I end up in jail?**  
Failing a **crime**, **GTA**, or **jail bust** can send you to jail for a set time (seconds). Attack doesn’t send you to jail.

**Jail list:**  
Shows real players and **jail NPCs** (spawned by the game). You can **bust** either. Busting a **player** out: 15 RP + any bust reward cash they set. Busting an **NPC** out: 25 RP + optional cash reward on the NPC.

**Bust success rate:**  
Based on your **total bust attempts** (not just successes). Rate increases with experience from 6% up to 90%. If you **fail** a bust, you go to jail for 30 seconds and your consecutive-bust streak resets.

**Bust reward:**  
When in jail you can set a **cash reward** for whoever busts you out. If someone succeeds, they get that cash (up to what you have). Set 0 to clear.

**Leave jail early:**  
You can **pay 3 points** to leave jail immediately (Jail → Leave).
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bank</strong></summary>
<div>

**Transfers:**  
Send **cash** to any player by username (case-insensitive). You cannot send to yourself or to a dead account. Rate limits may apply.

**Interest deposits:**  
Deposit cash for a fixed term; when it **matures** you get principal + interest. **No early withdrawal.**  
- 3h: 0.5%  
- 6h: 1.2%  
- 12h: 2.5%  
- 24h: 5%  
- 48h: 12%  
- 72h: 20%  
There is a **maximum total** in unclaimed interest deposits (e.g. $50M); the Bank page shows the limit.

**Swiss bank:**  
- **Deposit** cash from hand into Swiss; **withdraw** back to hand.  
- Your **Swiss limit** (e.g. $50M to start) caps how much you can hold in Swiss.  
- Swiss balance is **not** lootable in attacks (only cash on hand is).
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Organised Crime (OC)</strong></summary>
<div>

**Team heists:**  
You need **4 roles**: Driver, Weapons, Explosives, Hacker. Each slot can be **you** (“self”), **NPC**, or **another player** (invite by username). You set **split %** per role (e.g. 25% each).

**Jobs:**  
Country Bank (easiest), State Bank, City Bank, Government Vault (hardest). Each has a **success rate**, **cash pool** (split on success), and **RP**. You pay a **setup cost** when you run; reward always exceeds cost on success.

**Equipment:**  
You can buy equipment tiers (basic → master) to add a **success bonus** (e.g. +10% to +40%). Cost in cash when creating the heist.

**Cooldown:**  
**6 hours** between heists (or **4 hours** if you bought the OC timer reduction in the Store for 300 points).

**Flow:**  
Create a heist (job + roles + splits), send **invites** to players (they expire in 5 minutes). When everyone has accepted or you use NPCs for empty slots, **run** the heist. Success = cash and RP split by your %; failure = no rewards. NPCs get 35% of a full share of the cash pool.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bodyguards</strong></summary>
<div>

**Slots:**  
First slot is **free**; extra slots cost **100, 200, 300, 400 points** in order.  

**Armour:**  
Upgrade bodyguard armour (0→1→2→3→4→5) with points: 50, 100, 200, 400, 800. Better armour = they absorb more bullets in attacks.  
Daily events can make bodyguard costs **50% off** or **10% more**.

**Hire:**  
You can hire **other players** or **robots** (NPCs). Bodyguards appear on your profile and defend you in attack order (slot order). When a bodyguard is “killed” they’re removed; the attacker may get bounty rewards if there was a hitlist on them.
</div>
</details>
